# AI_Mental_Help_Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide supportive and non-diagnostic mental health conversations. The goal of this project is educational: to learn how to integrate AI tools into a full-stack application while respecting ethical and safety constraints.

This application is not intended to replace professional mental health services.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to:
- Learn how to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) into a web application
- Practice prompt engineering to guide AI behavior and tone
- Manage conversational context across user sessions
- Combine AI systems with backend services and databases
- Apply ethical considerations when designing AI systems

---

## AI Technologies and Tools Used
- Large Language Model (LLM) API
- Prompt engineering for empathetic and safe responses
- Context management using conversation history
- Backend: Node.js and Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How the AI Works
User messages are sent to the backend server, where they are combined with a system prompt that defines the AI assistant’s behavior. This prompt instructs the model to provide supportive and empathetic responses while avoiding medical diagnosis or treatment advice. Previous messages are included to preserve conversational context before sending the request to the LLM API.

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations
This project does not diagnose mental health conditions or provide medical advice. The AI is designed only to offer general support and reflection. Users are encouraged to seek help from qualified professionals when needed. The focus of this project is learning and experimentation rather than deployment as a real-world mental health tool.

## Features
- User authentication
- AI-powered supportive conversations
- Conversation history storage
- Simple and accessible user interface

---

## Future Improvements
- Sentiment analysis to adapt response tone
- Crisis detection and escalation logic
- Use of open-source or fine-tuned models
- Improved evaluation of AI response quality

## Disclaimer
This project was created for educational purposes as part of an AI course to explore new tools and concepts in artificial intelligence.
